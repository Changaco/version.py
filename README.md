`version.py` saves you from having to hard-code the version number of your
project by getting it from git tags (directly or indirectly).

To use the script, simply copy it into your project and call `get_version()`
in your `setup.py` file:

    from version import get_version

    setup(
        ...
        version=get_version(),
        ...
    )

By default the tags that are considered to be version numbers are those that
start with a digit. If you use a prefix, for example a `v`, modify the `PREFIX`
constant in `version.py` accordingly.

You need to distribute the `version.py` file in your sdist packages
by adding the following line in the `MANIFEST.in` file:

    include version.py

For the script to work within git archives (for example those automatically
generated by GitHub for each tag) you need to add the following line to the
`.gitattributes` file:

    version.py  export-subst

Note: if you don't care about git archives, or you're looking for a solution
that works with Mercurial, then you can use [setuptools_scm][setuptools_scm]
instead.
