`version.py` saves you from having to hard-code the version number of your
project by getting it from git tags (directly or indirectly).

The tags that are considered to be version numbers are those that start with
a digit, or with a `v` followed by a digit.

To use the script, simply copy it into your project and call `get_version()`
in your `setup.py` file:

    from version import get_version

    setup(
        ...
        version=get_version(),
        ...
    )

You need to distribute the `version.py` file in your sdist packages
by adding the following line in the `MANIFEST.in` file:

    include version.py

For the script to work within git archives (for example those automatically
generated by GitHub for each tag) you need to add the following line to the
`.gitattributes` file:

    version.py  export-subst

Note: if you don't care about git archives, or you're looking for a solution
that works with Mercurial, then you can use [setuptools_scm]
(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools_scm) instead.
